The main difference from a well engineered machinery and a well engineered software is the provision for change.

A successful software program is a living thing. Mechanics and electronics try to solve well known problems: carrying passengers,
amplifying sound, drilling. The problem space is well known, and every engineering step is a defined attempt at improvement.

Once a machine is designed, prototyped, and built, it could be very successfull, with only minor or no change for years.

For software programs, instead, success always brings change. Programs very seldom try to solve a well known problem, or address
a well known requirement. Having to interact with humans and human organisations, often means to address requirements which are only
partially understood, trying out incrementally slightly different approaches, while the way users interact with the program keep changing
in response.
